                Name: Erika Brown

                Sex: Female
                
                Age: 32
                
                Brief Summary: A young mother whose husband has just passed away. Trying to balance between taking care of her five year old daughter, dwindling finances and finishing a nursing certificate from BCIT, Erika doesn’t have time to actively look for a job. Truthfully, she’s a little glad because she wouldn’t know where to start. The last time she applied for a job, she found it in the newspaper. Now, with linkedin, indeed, craigslist… It’s just a little overwhelming, especially since she doesn’t have time to really look into her options. Plus, who would hire someone whose hours are minimal and so sporadic? 
                
                Behavioral Considerations:
                -	No matter what, Lina, her daughter, comes first. Erika is known to drop everything, even running out of an exam once, whenever the kindergarten calls.
                -	Always travels close by, preferring to complete her chores, from doctors to groceries, in walking distance from home. 
                -	Despite this, Erika takes her studies very seriously. She’s constantly looking towards the future and not dwelling on the past. 
                -	The memory of her husband causes her some pain and she’ll work herself harder just to not think about it.
                -	Always spends her nights with her daughter. Is only separated when Lina goes to kindergarten or extracurriculars during weekends.
                
                Frustrations:
                -	Too many job search options with formats she is unfamiliar with and unnecessary difficulty in applying.
                -	Too many jobs refuse to even look at her resume due to her limited time table.
                -	Constantly dipping into her savings despite having a scholarship to post-secondary.
                
                Goals:
                -	She aiming for a career in a few years and any experience that would help her future would be welcomed.
                -	Would love to work with children as she is aiming for pediatrics.
                -	Wants to provide more for her daughter, opportunities that a normal child should have.
                -	Wants Lina to be happy.
                
                Tasks:
                -	Finishing school.
                -	Begin a career.
                -	Love and care for Lina.
                -	Gaining funds to do the above.
